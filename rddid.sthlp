{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:rddid} performs a Difference-in-Discontinuities estimation. It estimates the discontinuity in {depvar} at the cutoff of {it:runvar} for a Treated group and subtracts the discontinuity found in a Control group.

{pstd}
It relies on {cmd:rdrobust} for underlying estimation and bandwidth selection.

{pstd}
Without the {opt bootstrap} option, analytic standard errors are computed assuming independence between groups.
This assumption is appropriate when groups correspond to distinct units (e.g., different countries or boundaries).
When groups share the same units (e.g., panel pre/post), use {opt bootstrap} to obtain valid standard errors.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt group(varname)} specifies the binary variable defining the groups. 1 must indicate the Treated/Post group, and 0 must indicate the Control/Pre group.

{phang}
{opt c(#)} specifies the RD cutoff for the running variable. The default is 0.

{phang}
{opt bw(string)} specifies how bandwidths are calculated if {opt h()} is not used. {opt common} calculates the optimal bandwidth for the Treated group and applies it to the Control group. {opt independent} calculates separate optimal bandwidths for each group.

{phang}
{opt bwselect(string)} specifies the bandwidth selector used by {cmd:rdbwselect}. The default is {opt mserd} (MSE-optimal, common). Other options include {opt msetwo} (MSE-optimal, two different), {opt cerrd} (CER-optimal, common), and {opt certwo} (CER-optimal, two different). Only relevant when {opt h()} is not specified.

{phang}
{opt h(numlist)} allows manual specification of bandwidths. If specified, this overrides {opt bw()}. It accepts three formats:{p_end}
{phang2}* {bf:1 number} (e.g., {cmd:h(5)}): Sets a symmetric bandwidth of 5.0 for both Treated and Control groups.{p_end}
{phang2}* {bf:2 numbers} (e.g., {cmd:h(5 10)}): Sets a symmetric bandwidth of 5.0 for the Treated group and 10.0 for the Control group.{p_end}
{phang2}* {bf:4 numbers} (e.g., {cmd:h(1 2 3 4)}): Sets fully asymmetric bandwidths. Treated group uses 1 (Left) and 2 (Right). Control group uses 3 (Left) and 4 (Right).{p_end}

{phang}
{opt est(string)} selects the estimation type. The default is {opt robust}, which uses bias-corrected point estimates with robust standard errors following Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014). {opt conventional} uses conventional point estimates and standard errors. {opt biascorrected} uses bias-corrected point estimates with conventional standard errors. Can be abbreviated as {opt est()}.

{phang}
{opt bootstrap} calculates standard errors using a bootstrap procedure. If this is not specified, the command calculates analytic standard errors assuming independence between the two groups. When combined with {cmd:vce(cluster {it:varname})}, the bootstrap resamples whole clusters rather than individual observations (cluster bootstrap). In the analytic path, {cmd:vce()} is passed directly to {cmd:rdrobust}.

{phang}
{opt reps(int)} specifies the number of bootstrap replications. The default is 50. This option is only relevant when {opt bootstrap} is specified.

{phang}
{opt seed(int)} sets the random-number seed before the bootstrap loop, ensuring reproducible results. This option is only relevant when {opt bootstrap} is specified.

{phang}
{it:rdrobust_options} allow you to customize the underlying estimation. For example, you can pass {cmd:vce(cluster id)} to cluster standard errors within each group's RD estimation, or {cmd:covs({it:varlist})} to include covariates.
